  {# The TSN theme is not yet ready to use the new version and language
     selector from the RTD theme v3. This would need to be replaced
     exactly in this 'sidebartitle' block by the old simple version
     output from the RTD Theme v2. Unfortunately, the RTD theme does
     not yet offer a separate block for replacing it with a customized
     version and language selector. Since this must be inserted exactly
     before the include of the 'searchbox' and in the RTD Theme it is
     protected by the environment variable 'READTHEDOCS' and the
     configuration options 'theme_version_selector' and
     'theme_language_selector' (we will never be allowed to set this
     constellation to True), the TSN Theme will use the following trick:

         This 'sidebartitle' block remains unchanged, but the 'searchbox'
         template in the TSN theme is extended right at the beginning by
         the old simple version output from the RTD theme v2.

     Here we leave only this explanation!
